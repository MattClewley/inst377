            >. I am a Senior Information Science major at the University of
            Maryland. My professional goals are to become a full stack developer
            and to get involved in helping others learn about web development
            and programming. I enjoy practicing my Spanish, thanks to Duolingo,
            and hope that one day I can use it for travelling or in the
            workplace.
