                <h3 style="color: goldenrod;">Why Did I choose InfoSci?</h3>
                <p>I choose Information Science because I loved technology and design, and wanted to combine the two. InfoSci allows me that opportunity by laying the groundwork for object oriented programming, database design & development, and now Web Development. I have a passion for programming for people, I like creating cool things that bring joy to others to experience. I also really enjoy the InfoSci professors. They all care and are willing to help students.</p>
