                        <p>My name is <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-clewley-79a915140/" target="_blank">Matthew Clewley</a></strong>. I am a Senior Information Science major at the University of Maryland. My professional goals are to become a full stack developer and to get involved in helping others learn about web development and programming. I enjoy practicing my Spanish, thanks to Duolingo, and hope that one day I can use it for travelling or in the workplace.</p>
